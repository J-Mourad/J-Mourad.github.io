I consider myself a lifelong learner and believe in working hard. I graduated from Faculty of Sciences Dhar El Mahraz Fes with Master's in Big Data Analytics and Smart Systems in June 2019.
Currently, I'm searching a new opportunity of research.

My interests are in the Applied ML, Texture Analysis and Computer vison domains. I got my first exposure to Machine Learning during a my participation in RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge in the Kaggle plateform, where i was involved in the development of an algorithm that automatically detects potential pneumonia cases.

<!-- At FSDM, I worked on several research projects under the guidance of *Prof. Ahmed Drissi El Maliyani*. Recently one of our research papers is under review at WINCOM2019 conference in which we proposed a two-stream neural network architecture for texture descrimination. -->

My research experience is providing me in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning field. All of my work is driven by these learnings.
