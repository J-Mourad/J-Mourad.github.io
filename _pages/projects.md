Here is a list of projects that I have worked on:

In this competition, My task was to develop an algorithm to identify and serve the most relevant opportunities to individuals, by uncovering signal in customer loyalty. <br />
This project was very successful, I learned a lot and managed to get a bronze medal.


- **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge**:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/kaggle/RSNAPneumoniaDetectionChallenge.png" alt="RSNAPneumoniaDetectionChallenge." %}
In this competition, I was challenged to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, the algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs. <br />
I enjoyed a lot the project and achieved Top 16% in the competition.
