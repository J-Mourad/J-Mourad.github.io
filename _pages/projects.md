These are some projects that I have worked on:

## Kaggle Competitions
- **Elo Merchant Category Recommendation**: 
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/kaggle/EloMerchantCategoryRecommendation.png" alt="EloMerchantCategoryRecommendation." %}
In this competition, Kagglers will develop algorithms to identify and serve the most relevant opportunities to individuals, by uncovering signal in customer loyalty.


- **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge**: In this competition, the challenge was to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, the algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.
